# PyQt5-Yolov8-Onnx-Gui

<h4>
  This repo is specially prepared for users who want to run onnx models. The program still has shortcomings and these can be improved. However, if you want to contribute to development, I wouldn't say no. I would be pleased.

  The aim of this project is to enable CUDA-based operation of onnx models in an interface and human detection. The detections made can be monitored instantly in the interface created with PyQt5. 

  You can select 4 onnx models via the interface, then add and run your rtsp camera or local webcam via the code. 

  Additionally, this interface provides the opportunity to detect objects in live streaming and use onnx models. 

  You can upload your own onnx models here and change the code. 

  Since it is difficult to find such properly working interfaces in the market, I am sharing my own project with you. Of course, the project has shortcomings and these will be improved in the future. If you would like to contribute please feel free to do so.
